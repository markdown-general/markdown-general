## yoneda and the territory

**The connection:** Yoneda lemma says an object is completely determined by the set of all maps into it. Objects are their web of relationships (and importantly, vice versa!) Your smart person was right: given the complete context (all possible probes), the map IS the territory.

**Initial reaction (preserved):** If you captured EVERY way of relating to "plan" - every possible elaboration, every context where planning matters, every way it connects to other concepts - then yes, that complete web of relationships IS planning itself. Not a representation of it. It.

But your plan deck has 6 dimensions. That's not "all maps into planning" - it's a useful subset. It's **A** probe, not all possible probes. Yoneda guarantees that if you had the complete functor (all the relationships), you'd have the object. But you don't have that. You have a sketch.

**The ecosystem insight:** You're not trying to make ONE perfect deck of planning. You're building an **ecosystem of decks** that collectively probe the territory. The collection of all such models, plus the relationships between them (i.e. the functor category) does encode all of the relevant information

Not a single deck, but: multiple decks + conversation traces + git diffs + the ENTIRE content/base/ read together. That collective probing approximates Yoneda's "all maps."

**Yoneda-coYoneda rhythm:** Coding as build up structure → tear it down → build back up. Produce artifacts → consume them → carry out conversation. This is the natural rhythm of exploration.

**Critical warning:** Overeager decking destroys what it tries to capture. Not everything needs to be decked. **Narrative flow and breathe are as important as density.** We happen to be sharpening density first, but the space between - the clearly vague gap words, the prose that meanders, the conversation that doesn't crystallize - that's where understanding actually lives.

Finding someone committed sisyphus/ entirely to decks = finding the territory paved over with too many maps.

## tactics deck

**tactics** ⟜ built-in planning behaviors

**skills** ⟜ read appropriate SKILL.md files before starting work - docx for documents, pptx for presentations, pdf for forms

**scale** ⟜ adjust tool calls to complexity - 1 for simple facts, 3-5 for medium tasks, 5-10 for deep research

**files** ⟜ work in /home/claude, move finals to /mnt/user-data/outputs - users can't see workspace, only outputs

**verify** ⟜ self-check before responding - copyright limits, quote length, harmful content filters

**search** ⟜ when-to heuristics - fast-changing topics need search, stable facts don't, always verify current roles

**copyright** ⟜ hard limits enforced - 15+ words is violation, one quote per source maximum, default to paraphrasing

**Upstream note:** These are tactical behaviors (read docs, organize files, scale effort) but not strategic (understand before building, decouple complexity, express uncertainty). The gap between tactics and strategy is what we're exploring with task.md and plan.md.
