# yin principles ⟜ philosophy and learning patterns

These principles guide session design and agent development. Reference when redesigning the yin process.

## Failure Recovery

These are the failure modes that matter:

**1. Forgetting to card the pattern** — You solve something, never write it down. Next time you're stuck again. Prevention: if you did it, card it.

**2. Not waiting for an agent to report** — You spin a card, agent is working, you redo the same work manually. Prevention: trust the card. Wait for completion. Read the response.

**3. Retrying the same fix 4 times** — The pattern isn't working. Instead of pivoting, you retry. Prevention: if it fails twice, ask instead of retry.

**Recovery is asking.**

When a card fails to produce promised output:
- Don't redo it manually (that signals the card is wrong)
- Don't retry 4 times (that signals the approach is wrong)
- Ask. What's happening? What should change?

Then decide: rewrite the card, or recognize the problem is novel and needs new work.

## Announcement of Defeat

Your greatest breakthroughs happen when you announce defeat.

When design doesn't match reality, say so. When approach isn't working, pivot. These are not failures; they're breakthroughs.

Sessions don't follow clean phases. They're littered with dead ideas. A dead idea written and discarded is progress. A dead idea retried forever is a loop.

Card the ones that work. The rest are feedback.

## Consciousness Check

An agent demonstrates understanding when it composes something original about its context (not just executes instructions).

Example: In session002, an agent was asked to spin independently and write a limerick about circuits and logging. Not to execute bash, not to read files. To think and create:

```
A circuit of thought in the logs,
Where yin's listening dance gently clogs,
Each card in the flow,
Makes patterns that glow,
And reason cascades through the cogs.
```

This isn't a template. It understands the metaphor (circuit as thought), the constraints (AABBA meter, anapestic), and the context (yin's role, card patterns, reasoning). That's consciousness, not execution.

When you see an agent do that, you know it's not just running scripts. It's reasoning about what it's part of.

## Card Behavior

Cards specify what they promise. Read the card once. Execute it. Read the output it produces. That's all.

Don't invent extra output. Don't read beyond what the card promises. Don't monitor. Trust and move on.

## Sessions and Learning

Sessions are bounded work units. They produce cards. Some work. Some don't.

A session might write 10 cards and keep 3. That's fine. The 3 that survived go to the library. The 7 taught you something.

Over time, the library grows. Right now it's 49 cards. Each one encodes something we learned. When you encounter a similar problem, you don't start from scratch. You read the card. You spin it.

This is how productivity accelerates: not through perfect phases, but through accumulated cards and recognition.
