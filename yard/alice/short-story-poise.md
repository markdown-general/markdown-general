# Alice: Short Story (Poise Curation)

The shore pressed in like a tidy parlor, and in that seam between water and carpet the Mock Turtle sighed so long the air grew damp with old sea-breaths. The Gryphon pried at the scene's corners with a pawful of rhythm and announced what the sea might teach a guest: etiquette, impulse, a turning until you forget which foot you began on. "You may not have lived much under the sea—" "I haven't," Alice answered, and a current of laughter waited in her throat. Then the Lobster Quadrille rose, a chain of steps along imaginary jelly, and an order of lobsters to steadiness and time.

Two lines, the Gryphon commanded, and the Mock Turtle cut an arc of slow gravity, as if his own sigh had become a dance move. "Advance twice," he murmured, "then set to partners—" "Change lobsters, and retire in same order," the Gryphon supplied, his voice a bell that wouldn't ring true. They moved Alice in the middle, treading on her toes, waving forepaws to keep time, while a song crawled out from a slow throat: "Will you walk a little faster? … Will you join the dance?" The snail—too wary, too far—replied only with a tilt of its shell toward the shore, a difference no one would name aloud. Be patient—stop and smell the flowers in the pauses.

"The bottle was not poison, so she ventured a sip; the cake was not a prison, and the world tilted, legible now." Curate / sculpt / prune / structure / trace / breathe, thought Alice, watching herself become two: the girl who speaks and the girl who keeps quiet.

"The trial's beginning," cried a distant cry, and they hurried, the sea in their shoes and the soup of farewell still steaming on the tongue: "Beautiful Soup," they sang.

## Curation Notes

This story emerged from a multi-phase pullup process: generating twelve interpretations of Alice's chapters, selecting the strongest (the Lobster Quadrille), then extracting micro-fragments from the others to enrich it.

**Fragments that sharpened meaning:**
- "The bottle was not poison, so she ventured a sip; the cake was not a prison..." (reframes perception as a tilt toward clarity)
- "Be patient—stop and smell the flowers in the pauses" (introduces poise through rhythm and interior quiet)
- "Curate / sculpt / prune / structure / trace / breathe" (crystallizes craft vocabulary into motion)

**Pruning decisions that strengthened the narrative:**
- Trimmed dialogue tangents and repetitive instructional flourishes, keeping exchanges concise and purposeful
- Pared redundant metaphors to tighten symbolism (tilt toward legibility, pause-driven meaning)
- Foreground inner gesture over outer spectacle, aligning with Alice's measured, poised stance

The tight decking approach—favoring small, precise cuts over elaborate elaboration—produced a story that feels both economical and richer in semantic range.
