# Alice: Short Story (Baseline)

A bottle waits. The label is a dare, the cake beside it a soft square of courage, and the door is smaller than my certainty; the key warms in my palm as if it remembers who I was before I mislaid the answer to my own name. Perhaps I am the lock! Or the hinge that squeaks when asked to choose.

Hurry! The hallway beats like a pocket-watch in shoes, muttering late, late, later, and my eyes mist until they run together and gather themselves as a small, embarrassed lake; I fold my name into a napkin so it won't be carried off by the polite current. Riddle: What door opens by forgetting its key?

Stir, stir, little spoon,
Turn the rules to afternoon,
Pour the verdict very soon.

At tea, the saucers advise me to stand while sitting, and the cups request silence by shouting; "Sir, would you pass the quiet, please?" I ask, and the kettle hisses a refusal that sounds like my mother's maiden name rearranged. "Madam, may I?" I begin, and the sugar tongs rise in objection, citing a schedule that was never posted and always enforced.

Croquet commences with beaks for mallets and prickled balls that grumble; nouns become verbs mid-flight, and the wickets address me by a title I did not earn, then retract it because the grass has changed its mind. Up is revised downward; straight becomes a suggestion.

Be it enacted, by the powers vested in whomever is presently listening, that due to the exigencies of time, tide, etiquette, and other matters hereinafter and elsewhere implied, the rule shall be amended while spoken, the subject corrected while predicated, and the accused addressed with utmost civility until such civility is no longer convenient. I stand in a courtroom made of teacups and wet footprints, asked to prove I am myself without using my name. I try, I fail, I bow. The gavel taps the surface of the tear-lake, which ripples into applause, and the door swings of its own accord, as if to say: the judgment was arbitrary, dear—so take it lightly, and go.
