## grind

To grind can mean many things. 

It can, in whole or in part.

- *curation* improving the quality of markdown 
- *compacting* changing the density of markdown
- *nudging* using and arranging markdown.
- *theorising* finding holes in markdown and filling or upstreaming them.
- *understanding* seeking coherence and structure across cards
- *computing* markdown/ -> markdown/

It is the task of improving.

### grind

**grind** ⟜ the practice of improvement

Curation, compacting, prompting, theorizing, computing. Density emerging through collaboration.


### mash

mash is a sub-concept. visceral, destructive curation.

### cast

**casting** - markdown into actions into markdown into actions ...
**Not declarative** ⟜ avoids cliche cascades and abstraction layers
**Functional** ⟜ captures the essence of functions (broad sense: agents that take inputs and give outputs)
