# card ⟜ executable pattern, archived and learnable

A card is a markdown file encoding a repeatable pattern we've observed. It's something we actually did (or want to do predictably), written down so it can be reshaped, tested, and spun again.

A card is not: tutorial, generic documentation, or fixed forever.

## Basic shape

```
title ⟜ one-liner describing the pattern

**instruction**
[the work, terse]

**comment** ⟜ [optional: constraints or learnings]
```

Add sections only if they carry signal. Trust that form will emerge with practice.

## How cards evolve

Heuristics are meant to evolve and shouldn't replace sensibility. Reshape, delete, or improve cards as the library learns. If a card doesn't work, rewrite it or recognize the problem is novel.

Cards are the persistence layer. The learning lives in the library, not in memory.
