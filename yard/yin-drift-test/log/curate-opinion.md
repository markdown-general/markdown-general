## Analyze card.md curation (25% cuts): agent1, agent3, agent4, agent6

**instruction**

→ Read work/grammar.md (decking, trace/prune/structure/breathe heuristics)

→ Analyze against curate.md curation patterns
  - Read work/card.md (original, 37 lines)
  - Read work/engineering.md (efficiency, idempotency principles)
  - Compare: yin-drift-test/log/agent1-simplified.md (44 lines, pedagogical)
  - Compare: yin-drift-test/log/agent3-simplified.md (44 lines, restructured)
  - Compare: yin-drift-test/log/agent4-simplified.md (9 lines, extreme compression)
  - Compare: yin-drift-test/log/agent6-simplified.md (37 lines, minimal change)

→ Document findings with curation lens
  - trace: Do versions preserve established pathways?
  - prune: What got removed? Dead weight or scaffolding?
  - structure: Are relationships intact?
  - breathe: Space for future elaboration?

→ Write findings to log/card-md-opinion-[timestamp].md

**comment** ⟜ Purely observational. No decisions. Findings feed library learning.
