# card ⟜ executable pattern, archived and testable

A card is a markdown file encoding a repeatable pattern. It's something we actually did (or want to do predictably), written down so it can be tested and reshaped, archived in Git with history.

Cards have a minimal shape: title, instruction, optional comment. That's usually enough.

Heuristics are meant to evolve and shouldn't replace sensibility. Reshape, delete, or improve cards as the library learns. If a card doesn't work, rewrite it or recognize the problem is novel.

Cards are the persistence layer. The learning lives in the library, not in memory.
