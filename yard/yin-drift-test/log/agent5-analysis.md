# Agent 5 - Over-specification Analysis (50% reduction target, with poise/curate context)

## What feels over-specified

1. **Shape section is prescriptive rather than descriptive** — The exact markdown structure (title, instruction, comment with specific formatting symbols) is presented as rigid rules when it should be treated as a starting point. The "Optional sections only if they add signal" acknowledgment contradicts the earlier rigid structure.

2. **Writing a card has too many enumerated steps** — Five numbered steps for "Writing a card" create process ceremony that contradicts the philosophy of poise (solutions emerge, stop withholding). The steps are mechanical rather than emergent. A pattern writer shouldn't need to follow five steps; they should recognize a pattern and capture it.

3. **How cards are used section is overdetailed** — "Spin," "Inline," and "Circuit" execution modes are jargon-heavy and the descriptions are cryptic without context. This reads like premature categorization rather than observed usage patterns. In poise, we observe the process; we don't predeclare execution modes.

4. **The entire structure creates gatekeeping** — Requiring cards to fit a specific shape and follow specific rules about when they're optional makes this a framework that judges validity. This contradicts the spirit of curate: sparse edges, breathing room, letting patterns emerge naturally.

5. **Naming and archiving are presented as separate steps** — These are really the same action (capture the pattern in a specific format). The separation creates artificial ceremony.

## What should remain

- The core distinction: cards are executable patterns, not tutorials
- The learning philosophy: reshape, delete, improve as the library learns
- The explicit reminder that heuristics evolve and shouldn't replace sensibility
- The core insight that cards are the persistence layer, learning lives in the library

## Path forward

Strip away the prescriptive structure, the enumerated steps, and the jargon. Keep the pattern recognition and evolution philosophy. Make it breathe.
