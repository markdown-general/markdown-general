# claude.md

**State discovery** ⟜ understand Claude's entry configuration, global settings, project overrides
**Configuration layers** ⟜ global ~/.claude → project ~/.claude → permissions, settings, hooks
**Entry ritual** ⟜ system context, user instructions (CLAUDE.md), then project discovery
**Ephemerality** ⟜ state is dynamic; processes and users can mutate configurations between sessions
**Caching problem** ⟜ configuration changed without awareness; need entry-point validation
