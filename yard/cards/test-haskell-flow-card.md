test-haskell-flow-card ⟜ end-to-end test of full development card flow

**instruction**
exercise full development loop (target: 15 minutes):
phase 0: lockit - establish ground truth, toolchain report, version strategy
phase 1: buildit - permanent build watcher on minimal work
phase 2: fixit - error/warning response loop
phase 3: cleanit - formatting, testing, linting
phase 4: writeit - documentation verification
phase 5: dependendit - dependency bounds
phase 6: verifyit - merge verification
phase 7: publishit - tagging, release
verify: flows-log accumulates correctly, each card executes, synthesis produces actionable decisions.
