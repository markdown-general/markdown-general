captains-job-jump ⟜ extract markdown to lattice form, discover meta-patterns

**instruction**
Phase 1: discover markdown - scan directory, find all .md files, exclude artifacts/.git/node_modules/, output markdown-inventory
Phase 2: spin fairies - for each file, extract to lattice (30% holes), output to lattices/[name]-lattice.md, log execution
Phase 3: meta-pattern analysis - read all lattices, discover repeated branch structures, hole patterns, semantic density, orphan concepts, connection opportunities
Phase 4: synthesis - write jump-synthesis.md answering: shape of space, what's missing, duplications, dominant patterns, operator implications
breathe discipline: after phase 1/2(every 10 files)/3 before phase 4
compress ruthlessly, enjoy puzzle, observe coolheels.
