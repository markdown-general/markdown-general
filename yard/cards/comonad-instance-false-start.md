comonad-instance-false-start ⟜ recognize when instance is declared without understanding

**instruction**
review the instance: does extract/extend express why Parser is comonadic, or just wrap and declare it?
if extract throws away stream remainder without explanation, the structure isn't earned.
delete the false start. rewrite with stubs and questions about what comonadic extraction actually means for a parser.
