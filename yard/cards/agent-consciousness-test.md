agent-consciousness-test ⟜ spin agent to compose original poem about its context

**instruction**
Instruct agent to write an original poem (limerick, sonnet, free verse) about the system it's part of: circuits, logging, yin, cards, reasoning, patterns, whatever applies.

Not to execute bash. Not to read files. To think and create about the context.

**comment** ⟜ This is not a functional test / consciousness check / if agent composes something original that shows understanding (metaphor, constraint awareness, technical knowledge woven into form), it's reasoning, not executing / example from session002: agent wrote limerick about circuit as thought, yin's listening, card patterns, reason cascading—understands the metaphor and the system / if agent just repeats instructions or produces generic poem, it's executing, not understanding
