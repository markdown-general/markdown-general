rewrite of

- work/grammar.md
- work/decking.md
- work/lattice.md
- work/range.md

Take the content across all of these files and create two files:

◊
⟝yard/pattern.md⟞
  ⟜ a file to place a full description of patterning including all existing examples.

You are free to make editorial changes to the existing text and fix semantic or style discoherence but can you please write out justifications for major change.

The yard/pattern.md has no set length but we would ask for a clarity for teh document as separate information to the tin/pattern.md.

⟝ yin/pattern.md ⟞
  ⟜ A file to replace these files in work/ representing an efficient introduction to patterning in markdown-general.

The yin/pattern.md should aim for around 12k. In your report can you describe what you would add in from yard/pattern.md given another 3k budget and what you would trim if we asked for another 3k to bring it down to 9k.

⟝ yin/pattern-edit-decisions.md ⟞
  ⟜ Written report on editorial and structural choices made during consolidation.
  ⟜ Explain: structure chosen, major edits made, rationale for what stayed/moved/cut.
  ⟜ Document the 3k budget trade-offs (add/trim scenarios).

⟝ pushup recommendation ⟞

Your recommendation for changes to readme.md based on this rewrite.
