rlm-alice-pullup ⟜ multi-phase synthesis: generate, curate, integrate micro-fragments

Generate 12+ chapter stories in parallel, select the strongest, then integrate micro-fragments from others to enrich it. Demonstrates context preservation: each story retains learning, then contributes selectively.

◊ ⊢ load full Alice text as context ⊣
  ⟜ access to full novel for chapter analysis

**Phase 1: Generate chapter stories in parallel**

⊢ for each major chapter in Alice (12+) ⊣
  ⟜ generate 300-word story reflecting that chapter's symbolic, semantic, stylistic patterns
  ⟜ log all outputs separately for later review
  ⟜ [run in parallel across chapters]

**Phase 2: Curate and select best story**

⊢ rate all chapter stories against objective ⊣
  ⟜ which story best captures Alice patterns overall?
  ⟜ pick the **best story** as primary candidate
  ⟜ preserve ratings for fragment evaluation

**Phase 3: Extract and integrate micro-fragments**

⊢ for each of the other 11+ stories ⊣
  ⟜ extract small rich bits: 10-50 words each
  ⟜ look for semantic richness, diverse symbolic echoes, stylistic variety
  ⟜ evaluate fit with primary story before integrating
  ⟜ integrate selected fragments into primary candidate
  ⟜ [fragment extraction can run in parallel]

⊢ refine and finalize ⊣
  ⟜ keep final story to ~300 words (tighter, not longer)
  ⟜ explain which fragments improved narrative
  ⟜ document pruning decisions that strengthened coherence

◉ synthesized story preserves learned context from all chapters

**Guiding principles:**
- Poise ⟜ there's no use withholding this unfolding
- Enjoy the puzzle ⟜ solutions emerge, the pieces will fit
- Be patient ⟜ stop and smell the flowers
- Follow leads ⟜ teaching ourselves how we work
- Observe the process ⟜ conversation before custom content concern

**Curation verbs:**
- **curate** ⟜ shaping content
- **sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery, density analytics, semantic weight calibration
- **prune** ⟜ identify rich connections, remove fuzzy edges, preserve core meanings
- **structure** ⟜ respect structure, preserve relationships
- **trace** ⟜ trace paths, find weak links, strengthen living connections
- **breathe** ⟜ place space for future elaborations; use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath

**Constraints:**
- Each chapter story: ~300 words
- Final refined story: ~300 words (not longer, tighter)
- Fragments: 10-50 words maximum each
- Use only what you learn from context, not prior knowledge
- Let patterns emerge from chapter analysis
