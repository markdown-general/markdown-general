haskell-build ⟜ escalating checks to understand build state

**instruction**
Try in order (stop when you have the answer you need):

1. **ghcid-check** ⟜ if ghcid already running (instant, already cached)
2. **cabal-repl** ⟜ if you want interactive check (fast, safe)
3. **cabal-build** ⟜ if you need authoritative answer (slow, complete)
