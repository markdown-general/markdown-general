# tools/timer.md

**timer** ⟜ enforce worker deadlines and write timeout blowup reports

**what it does** ⟜ monitors foreman-workers.md for active workers, kills them at deadline, writes blowup reports

**why** ⟜ prevent orphaned workers hanging forever; provide timeout evidence for foreman analysis

**who** ⟜ foreman infrastructure, spawned after listener at session start

## example

```bash
# Start timer monitoring ~/self/foreman/foreman-workers.md
timer --workers ~/self/foreman/foreman-workers.md --responses ~/self/foreman/responses/

# In foreman-workers.md, mark worker as active:
# | 1 | scan-task | 14:22:01 | 14:22:11 | active | | |

# At 14:22:11, timer detects deadline passed
# Writes: ~/self/foreman/responses/worker-1-blowup.md
# Updates foreman-workers.md: status → "timeout", actual-completion → 14:22:11
```

## api

**Arguments:**
- `--workers FILE` ⟜ path to foreman-workers.md table (required)
- `--responses DIR` ⟜ directory for blowup report files (required)
- `--interval SECONDS` ⟜ check interval in seconds (default: 2)

**foreman-workers.md format:**
```
| id | card | spin-time | timeout-deadline | status | actual-completion | notes |
|----|------|-----------|------------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| 1  | task | 14:22:01  | 14:22:11         | active |                   | msg   |
```

**Output:**
- Blowup report ⟜ `responses/worker-{id}-blowup.md` with timeout evidence
- Updated table ⟜ worker status changed to "timeout", actual-completion set to enforcement time

**Behavior:**
- Parses foreman-workers.md table every `--interval` seconds
- For each worker with status "active":
  - Compares current time to timeout-deadline
  - If deadline passed: writes blowup report, updates table
- Only enforces once per worker (tracks killed workers)
- Runs indefinitely until interrupted

## installation

**Location:** `~/markdown-general/artifacts/bin/timer`

**Wrapper:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sed -n '/^```python$/,/^```$/p' ~/markdown-general/zone/tools/timer.md | sed '1d;$d' | python3 - "$@"
```

**One-liner test:**
```bash
timer --help
```

## tips

**Clock alignment** ⟜ timer uses system clock. Foreman and timer must be on same machine for deadline matching to work.

**Table parsing** ⟜ timer expects strict markdown table format. Missing pipe characters or misaligned columns will cause parse failures. Validate table format before spinning timer.

**Blowup report is evidence** ⟜ contains worker id, card name, deadline, enforcement time. Foreman can analyze this to refine timeout estimates for next session.

**idempotent enforcement** ⟜ timer tracks killed workers by id to avoid re-killing. If workers table is cleared between sessions, idempotency is lost (design limitation).

**Status update is non-atomic** ⟜ timer reads table, decides to enforce, writes blowup, updates table. If foreman updates table simultaneously, race conditions possible. In practice, foreman doesn't modify table during enforcement.

## status

**Tests:** passing (deadline detection, blowup generation, table updates, idempotency)
**Last updated:** 2026-01-13
**Known issues:** None

## examples

### basic deployment

Enforce deadlines for all active workers:

```bash
timer --workers ~/self/foreman/foreman-workers.md --responses ~/self/foreman/responses/
```

### with logging

Log enforcement actions:

```bash
timer --workers ~/self/foreman/foreman-workers.md --responses ~/self/foreman/responses/ --log /tmp/timer.log
```

### faster enforcement

Check every 1 second instead of 2:

```bash
timer --workers ~/self/foreman/foreman-workers.md --responses ~/self/foreman/responses/ --interval 1
```

## tests

### deadline detection

Verify timer detects expired deadlines:

```bash
# Create test structure
mkdir -p /tmp/timer-test/responses
cat > /tmp/timer-test/workers.md << 'EOF'
# foreman-workers

| id | card | spin-time | timeout-deadline | status | actual-completion | notes |
|----|------|-----------|------------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| 1  | test | 10:00:00  | 10:00:01         | active |                   | test  |
EOF

# Wait for deadline to pass
sleep 2

# Run timer once
timeout 1 timer --workers /tmp/timer-test/workers.md --responses /tmp/timer-test/responses/ || true

# Check blowup was created
[[ -f /tmp/timer-test/responses/worker-1-blowup.md ]] && echo "✓ Blowup created"

# Check table was updated
grep "timeout" /tmp/timer-test/workers.md > /dev/null && echo "✓ Status updated"

# Cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/timer-test
```

### idempotency

Verify timer doesn't re-kill workers:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/timer-idem/responses
cat > /tmp/timer-idem/workers.md << 'EOF'
| id | card | spin-time | timeout-deadline | status | actual-completion | notes |
|----|------|-----------|------------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| 1  | test | 10:00:00  | 10:00:01         | active |                   | test  |
EOF

sleep 2

# Run timer in background for 3 seconds
timeout 3 timer --workers /tmp/timer-idem/workers.md --responses /tmp/timer-idem/responses/ > /tmp/timer-idem/output.log 2>&1 &
wait

# Count how many times worker-1 was enforced
COUNT=$(grep -c "ENFORCE: Worker 1" /tmp/timer-idem/output.log || echo 0)
[[ $COUNT -eq 1 ]] && echo "✓ Only enforced once" || echo "✗ Enforced $COUNT times"

# Cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/timer-idem
```
