work/card.md ⟜ simplify through agent analysis at different reduction targets

Spin agents to analyze what feels over-specified and produce simplified versions at different reduction levels. Compare strategies to understand which heuristics are essential.

◊ ⊢ spin agents to analyze and reduce ⊣
  ⟜ read work/card.md; understand what feels over-specified
  ⟜ write analysis to log/card-md-analysis-agent[n].md
  ⟜ reduce document by target: [25%, 50%, 75%]
  ⟜ remember: heuristic evolves; don't sacrifice sensibility for brevity
  ⟜ write simplified version to log/card-md-simplified-agent[n].md

⊢ collect outputs and compare ⊣
  ⟜ review reduction strategies across agents
  ⟜ identify which reduction level preserves essential meaning
  ⟜ note patterns in what agents preserved vs. removed
