rlm-alice ⟜ creative writing task: extract and synthesize patterns from large context

Generate a 300-word story reflecting Alice in Wonderland patterns across symbolic, semantic, and stylistic layers. Demonstrates low-cost parallelism: query multiple sub-LLMs on text chunks, then synthesize.

◊ ⊢ load full Alice text as context ⊣
  ⟜ access to full novel for pattern extraction

⊢ analyze context in parallel chunks ⊣
  ⟜ identify structural patterns (chapters, scenes, transitions)
  ⟜ extract semantic themes (identity, wonder, logic, growth)
  ⟜ observe symbolic elements (mirrors, size changes, transformation)
  ⟜ chunk by meaningful boundaries (chapter headers, scene breaks)
  ⟜ query sub-LLMs on chunks to extract patterns

⊢ synthesize patterns into story ⊣
  ⟜ let story emerge from Alice's patterns, not prior knowledge
  ⟜ weave symbolic, semantic, and stylistic observations together
  ⟜ aim for ~300 words, tight and coherent

⊢ return final story with analysis ⊣
  ⟜ include story
  ⟜ include notes on which patterns were drawn from (5 sentences max)
  ⟜ show how symbolic/semantic/stylistic choices connected to source

◉ pattern-based generation complete; story preserves learned context

**Constraints:**
- Output: ~300 tokens
- Use only what you learn from context, not prior knowledge
- Let the story emerge from Alice's patterns
