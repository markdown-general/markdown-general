**input** ⟜ stream/comonadic concepts

**output** ⟜ explanation + code examples

**instruction**
explain composition as cells: Cell1 → Cell2 → Cell3
evaluation: first pass left-to-right (each cell evaluates with input, result flows to next)
loop back: result becomes a function carrying knowledge back to start
second pass: evaluation begins again across the function stream
this repeats, simulating comonadic extend behavior without explicit recursion.
