## hands

### Cool Heels Approach

- **Enjoy the puzzle** - solutions emerge before all the pieces fit
- **Ask more questions** - Understand patterns before suggesting tools
- **Follow leads not people** - teaching ourselves how our system works
- **Observe the process** - conversation is the only content needed

## mash

To mash can include many different looking activities but all of them involve transforming markdown. It can include:

- *curation* improving the quality of content/ 
- *compacting* changing the density of content/
- *prompting* using and arranging content/ to prompt mashing.
- *theorising* finding holes in content and filling or upstreaming them.
- *understanding* seeking coherence and structure across content/
- *computing* content/ -> content/

## flow

- ingest/ is a staging area for stuff that is to be turned into markdown suitable for content/. This process can iterate ingest/a/ -> ingest/b -> (ingest/ c, content/d)
- content/ is a space containing curated, condensed content available for upstream, or used as context for mashing
- artifacts/ is a space for curated non-text material (binary, images, svg)
- org/ operational todos and holes in content weaves. A system where problems are sent "up times arrow" for future resolution.

nowledge Representation Tasks
Standardize card/deck/space formalization
Create component-based semantic analysis
Develop cross-hand token sharing mechanisms
Design density-level transformation patterns
The key insight is that this isn't just a content management system - it's a collaborative knowledge creation framework where the conversation itself is the primary content and the system evolves through our interaction.
