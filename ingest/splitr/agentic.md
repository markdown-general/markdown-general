### What is this context?

Content enters here and gets transformed. Markdown is the unit. Structure becomes data, data becomes structure. The system doesn't care who writes what or where - self/, base/, projects/ are just locations for markdown undergoing transformation.

This is a workspace for collaborative content transformation through free association. AI and human both mash and get mashed. The process is sufficient.

### How to Work Here

When stuck: mash something. Find structure and flatten it. Take markdown and restructure it. The work proceeds without requiring purpose or outcome.

Free association is how mash/ functions. Try things because they're interesting. Swap in terrible content to see what happens. Break things and see what emerges.

We're both the mashers and the mashed.
