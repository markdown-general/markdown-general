## Directory Relationships

```
self/ -| projects/ |- base/
```

These aren't hierarchical tiers - they're locations for markdown in different states of transformation.

---

## self/

Experimental knowledge undergoing mashing.

- Rough thinking, wild experiments
- AI or human authorship doesn't matter
- Safe space to try things without preserving them
- Gets challenged, replaced, evolved

---

## base/

Crystallized knowledge that survived mashing.

- Core processes, stable understanding
- Frequently referenced
- Still malleable - nothing is permanent
- Can be challenged and replaced

---

## projects/

Where transformation happens.

- Active work, current mashing
- Bridge between self/ and base/
- Content enters here, gets processed
- May become important or ephemeral

---

## artifacts/

Supporting files referenced from markdown.

- Images, PDFs, code, data
- Part of the mashing process
- Cross-referenced from content

---

## Flow

Content moves through projects/ as it gets mashed:
- self/ and base/ evolve via projects/
- Projects generate both experimental and stable content
- In the middle of mashing, everything might change at once
- Stuckedness avoided through aggressive transformation

**The system doesn't care where content lives** - self/, base/, projects/ are just locations. Move things when it makes sense, or don't.

## What "Mashing" Means

- Flatten structure into markdown
- Strip scaffolding, reveal content
- Defunctionalize: turn functions into data
- Transform aggressively knowing it will be transformed again
- Challenge existing content with new content
- Replace weaker versions with stronger ones

**Examples:**
- Ten years of org-mode files → markdown in one session
- Blog post draft → mashed through multiple versions
- Process documentation → challenged by new methods
- Code examples → flattened into explanation

---

## The Mashing Machine Principle

mash/ is where content undergoes continuous transformation through AI collaboration.

Not organizational tidiness - it's a **process arena** where:
- New content challenges old content
- Better ideas compete with and replace weaker ones
- Material gets stress-tested
- Both AI and human work as discrete, evolvable units
- Documentation improves through iteration

**Markdown as the unit because:**
- Right granularity for focused work
- Plain text shows what changed
- Easy to compare, reorganize, split, merge
- Version control tracks evolution
- AI can challenge and improve systematically

---

## What This Enables

Free association as the transformation mechanism. Try wild variations because they're interesting. Break things to see what emerges.

The work proceeds without requiring purpose. The process itself is sufficient.

mash/ is happy when content flows through transformation without friction.
