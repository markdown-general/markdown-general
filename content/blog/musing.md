# the turkeys of astolat

summer

i cant save the Children of Gaza so i save the turkey chicks instead the crows dive bomb the nest before the chicks are even out or they dont watch the nest at all but watch my eyes watching

cheep cheep was my best save baby crow had it pinned, ripping feathers out i expected yet another deadun but as i went to clean the debris, it opened an eye and mouthed: cheep cheep.

and then ran, running fast but pursued, ducking under the neighbours fence. crows crowing because that's their killing zone, in cement and sun the chicks freeze - dna compute failure. but i got there and scooped it up, winning that race.

I got 3 chicks out over summer, put them in the neighbours where the noisy minors hold sway. The crows raised two fledglings with magnificent coats and a bolshie strut.

autumn

i cant feed the Children of Gaza so i feed the turkeys instead

winter

climate change is fucking with billy - his waddle is glowing again outside of season and the girls are confused.

but maybe it's because i feed all the turkeys now; under neighbour's gaze and aprobation bush turkeys are hated for their nest building they say; but their ugliness interferes with some grassy ideal of what a backyard is.

if they ask me why I feed them, i will tell them because they asked me, it's as simple as that. why should i say no? i have access to credit cards and the best premium wild bird feed i can find. they live in my yard, ffs, we share a small world together.

thirteen turkeys in the tree this morning, i kind of understand the side-eye. i will promise to curtail my involvement when they curtail their support of empire, of genocide, of israel, of their cat being allowed to roam free.

Pynchon was rejected as a graduate student of maths after winning awards for his first novel, V.

… Who claims Truth, Truth abandons. History is hir'd, or coerc'd, only in Interests that must ever prove base. She is too innocent, to be left within the reach of anyone in Power,—who need but touch her, and all her Credit is in the instant vanish'd, as if it had never been. She needs rather to be tended lovingly and honorably by fabulists and counterfeiters, Ballad-Mongers and Cranks of ev'ry Radius, Masters of Disguise to provide her the Costume, Toilette, and Bearing, and Speech nimble enough to keep her beyond the Desires, or even the Curiosity, of Government…

— Mason & Dixon (p. 350)

"Low-lands" (1960), features a meditation on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as a metaphor for telling stories about one's own experiences.

“Time moves on but one axis,” advised Dr. Blope, “past to future—the only turnings possible being turns of a hundred and eighty degrees. In the Quaternions, a ninety-degree direction would correspond to an additional axis whose unit is √-1. A turn through any other angle would require for its unit a complex number.” “Yet mappings in which a linear axis becomes curvilinear—functions of a complex variable such as w=ez, where a straight line in the z-plane maps to a circle in the w-plane,” said Dr. Rao, “do suggest the possibility of linear time becoming circular, and so achieving eternal return as simply, or should I say complexly, as that.”

The book closes, after all, with Oedipa's recitation of a sterile set of binaries, which exclude the middle: "how had it ever happened here, with the chances once so good for diversity? For it was now like walking among matrices of a great digital computer, the zeroes and ones twinned above, hanging like balanced mobiles right and left, ahead, thick, maybe endless"

"one little movement, against all that massive complex of information, destroyed over and over with each power stroke" (p. 77).

“Quaternionic Weapon”

Vectorists and Quaternionists that has a basis in historical fact and that ends with vectors becoming mathematical “truth” and Quaternionists losing their “Kampf ums Dasein” \[struggle for life\] (AD 533).

The surveying lines fail to meet in one point so that there remains the “Wedge,” a piece of land between borders and jurisdictions that shows that “of Mathematickal Necessity there do remain \[…\] pockets of Safety” (MD 69).

Dr. V. Ganesh Rao explains: “If you were a vector, mademoiselle, you would begin in the ‘real’ world, change your length, enter an ‘imaginary’ reference system, rotate up to three different ways, and return to ‘reality’ a new person” (AD 539)

It encourages the identification and use of spaces of freedom that reside in imaginary domains and mathematical probabilities, that allow action to be taken in the infinitesimally small moment before disaster strikes, and that exist out of “Mathematickal Necessity.”

mathematics stands for postmodernity’s greater uncertainty but also greater freedom, and the twentieth and twenty-first centuries raise hope for the possibility of salvaging math from its misappropriation in the Enlightenment and of realizing the potential inherent in its uncertain and imaginary aspects.

paranoia: all things are connected “in spheres joyful or threatening about the central pulse of \[one\]self

Tristero, a sub rosa postal system at war for centuries with all officially sanctioned postal services, first in the old world, then in the new.

Pynchon implies that Tristero, whatever its status as literal reality, is in effect a necessary fiction, a metaphor for the idea of an alternative to a closed system.

Thus, one can read the novel as Pynchon’s account of why he has gone underground.

Figuratively, says Pynchon, the world is separated from its end only by “the last delta-t,” the last infinitesimal unit of time and space between the rocket and its target.

To mark a right Line upon the Earth is to inflict upon the Dragon’s very flesh a sword-slash, a long, perfect scar

### The Lectern - AtD

<http://thelectern.blogspot.com/2013/07/against-day-thomas-pynchon.html>

Double refraction appears again and again as the key element, permitting a view into a Creation set just to the side of this one, so close as to overlap, where the membrane between the worlds, in many places, has become too frail, too permeable for safety…

like the bifurcation of image one sees in the crystal known as Iceland spar

V: Perhaps history this century is rippled with gathers in its fabric such that if we are situated at the bottom of the fold, it’s impossible to determine warp, woof, pattern or anything else. By virtue , however, of existing in one gather it is assumed that there are others, compartmented off into sinuous cycles each of which come to assume greater importance than the weave itself and destroy any continuity.

So of course we use them \[…\] we harness and sodomize them, photograph their degradation, send them up onto the high iron and down into mines and sewers and killing floors, we set them beneath inhuman loads, we harvest from them their muscle and eyesight and health, leaving them in our kindness a few miserable years of broken gleanings.

The great weight and length of the work signal another kind of seriousness, one that asks us to appreciate the abstract beauty of theorems and algorithms and to read history in their light.

Undoubted human identities, masses of souls, mounted, pillioned, on foot, ranging along together by the millions over the landscape accompanied by a comparably unmeasurable herd of horses……thus galloping in unceasing flow ever ahead, denied any further control over their fate, the disconsolate company were borne terribly over the edge of the visible world…

She even tried, from what little calculus she'd picked up, to explain it to Franz as At approaching zero, eternally approaching, the slices of time growing thinner and thinner, a succession of rooms each with walls more silver, transparent, as the pure light of the zero comes nearer

GR quotes

"a fold or closure"

"isn't that every paranoid's wish? to perfect methods of immobility?" (572)

Katje confesses "I don't know any more who Slothrop really was" (659) and Pig Bodine is "one of the few who can still see Slothrop as any sort of integral creature any more. Most of the others gave up long ago trying to hold him together, even as a concept" (740)

Pynchon introduces the double integral in a long passage (299-302) ab

"The moving vehicle is frozen, in space, to become architecture, and timeless. It was never launched. It will never fall"

Finally, in the sentences following the passage just quoted above, Pynchon gives the At and double integral "moment" idea an even larger significance by relating it to "that purified shape latent in the sky" (209) and the impli- cations thereof: And what is the specific shape whose center of gravity is the Brenn- schluss Point? Don't jump at an infinite number of possible shapes. There's only one. It is most likely an interface between one order of things and another. (302)

"an interface between one order of things and another" (302).

First the Rocket's countdown is related to the Kabbalist Sephiroth (ten spheres or aspects of the original pulse of life energy sent by God into the void) and Tree of Life:

"Now the Sephiroth fall into a pattern, which is called the Tree of Life. It is also the body of God. . … So although the Rocket count- down appears to be serial, it actually conceals the Tree of Life, which must be apprehended all at once, together, in parallel. "Some Sephiroth are active or masculine, others passive or feminine. But the Tree itself is a unity, rooted exactly at the Bodenplatte."s It is the axis of a particular Earth, a new dispensation, brought into being by the G

Rocket: when a questioning visitor asks Kabbalist spokesman Steve Edel- man, "You mean someone's actually found the Bodenplatte? The Pole?" Edelman answers affirmatively, "The delta-t itself" (754).

And it is just here, just at this dark and silent frame, that the pointed tip of the Rocket, falling nearly a mile per second, absolutely and for- ever without sound, reaches its last unmeasurable gap above the roof of this old theatre, the last delta-t. (760)

What if it should hit exactly-ahh, no-for a split second you'd have to feel the very point, with the terrible mass above, strike the top of the skull. (7)

the At, like the singular point, "carries a luminosity and enigma at which something in us must leap and sing, or withdraw in fright" (396).

    6 The poetry of William Blake, especially Milton (e.g., Milton 35: 42-53), con- tains images of a moment whose significance is quite similar to that of the At. F. B. Curtis, in his essay "Blake and the 'Moment of Time': An Eighteenth Century Contro- versy in Mathematics" (Philological Quarterly, 51, ii (1972), 460-70), even asserts that Blake's symbolic usage of the term "moment" arose out of Blake's awareness of the eighteenth century controversy over the ontological status of the infinitesimals in New- 208 s concept of a "moment" (correspond- ing to what we have examined as At above) "seemed to designate simultaneously a unit having 'sensible' existence in the material world as well as a mathematical concept with no such reality. . . . Blake exploited this ambiguity" (Curtis, 467). So, we might add, does Pynchon

## politics

## policies you will never be able to vote for.

- good faith rather than arguing correctness/perfection

## draft budget honesty piece

A foundation of MMT is that money is a creature of the State, so that it's nature can be found in the laws and practices of the sovereign land issuing currency.

Finance, from this foundational perspective, is the provisioning of money to society by the state, governance of it's impact on the economy of people and land and capital, and responsibility of the public service to ensure that the guilding principles of finance, what do we want to do with the real economy of people, land and capital, remains open to political contestation.

As Keating said, having a moment of clarity about the forces he helped unleash, said that the economy is there for society. If our finance system doesn't work for us, MMT is a recipe for how to make a better one.

\[Charter of Budget Honesty\](<https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012C00230>) —

Everyone takes this seriously. The superannuation system was built from it, as was all the sovereign asset reserves. All of federal government accounting reckons with it.

What is Fiscal Management? —

"But real fiscal responsibility doesn’t zero in on personal prudence; it challenges systemic power. That’s why I love Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)." - @RaulACarrillo

At one level, the use of \`sound\` is a perjorative hurled by neo-liberalism at the functional finance of Lerner, which MMT embraces much of. The Act defines it, however, so any slur signification quickly loses it's sting.

Here it is, the definition in it's entirety:

\`\`\` (1) The principles of sound fiscal management are that the Government is to: (a) manage financial risks faced by the Commonwealth prudently, having regard to economic circumstances, including by maintaining Commonwealth general government debt at prudent levels; and (b) ensure that its fiscal policy contributes: (i) to achieving adequate national saving; and (ii) to moderating cyclical fluctuations in economic activity, as appropriate, taking account of the economic risks facing the nation and the impact of those risks on the Government’s fiscal position; and (c) pursue spending and taxing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of stability and predictability in the level of the tax burden; and (d) maintain the integrity of the tax system; and (e) ensure that its policy decisions have regard to their financial effects on future generations. (2) The financial risks referred to in paragraph (1)(a) include risks such as: (a) risks arising from excessive net debt; and (b) commercial risks arising from ownership of public trading enterprises and public financial enterprises; and (c) risks arising from erosion of the tax base; and (d) risks arising from the management of assets and liabilities. \`\`\`

What does MMT bring to Fiscal Management? `=`

Taxation —

MMT lacks empirics on the following split of the taxation system:

- Which part, and how big is the taxation system responsible for bootstrapping public money, and
- Which part, and how big is the taxation system responsible for surpressing economic activity that is considered to hurt societal goals as defined by the current public policy platform under governance.

The lack of MMTs actually being in charge somewhere means that large-scale taxation reform is out of reach when you take account of the current state of Economic discource, where the public and the political classes are blinded by the exogenous money meme; that taxes pay for roads, that a person who has worked hard and paid taxes all their life means that a government has squirreled away some resources to support them in their dotage.

All of these remain spiritually true under MMT. By taxing outrageous cash flows that are obviously due to exploitation of the system via economic rents, usually sucking off the government teat, better roads may be built. The government should always provision for looking after old people and, I say, in comfort. Others may wish to gatekeep this to those that suffered heavy taxation when they were young, but to what purpose?

But MMT is memetically weak until the public awareness rises, as the Act envisages.

Government Debt —

Regarding the government bond market as mostly a financial risk management tool highlights two major transfers; inflation and credit risk.

There is, in general, a transfer of inflation risk from the government to the private sector as a result of issuing government bonds. MMT sees government finance mostly via it's effect on real resource allocation, which, for want of a better term, is inflation to be actively managed. The moral hazard of government officials unloading inflation risk on the private sector when they should be reducing it across the whole of the economy is unsettling.

There is also significant credit risk transferred from the government to the private sector, via the non-Commonwealth debt market, that certainly encompasses State debt but also Universities, Local Authorities, Infrastructure debt (backed mostly by government contractual promise) and then banking system debt as a regulated money creation system.

In a sovereign context, this seems like another strange outsourcing of risk management. If a local mayor becomes flummoxed by a sharp investment banker, and runs up large debts that cannot be justiofied by the public assets of the jurisdiction, this is a failure of governance that should not hide on private sector balances. Ultimately, the Commonwealth will pay and should pay the debt of any Australian sovereign body.

National Savings —

Ultimately this means to improve the productive capacity of the economy, via improvments to people (knowledge, media, services economy), to land and the built environment (social infrastructure) and having an effective industrial production or access to a trading partner who has one.

It also means, from an MMT pov, that the nation should ensure it is never overly beholden to debt or equity denominated in another sovereign currency.

Specific to private financial positioning, a major driver of government bonds could become private savings demand. Integrated with the Superannuation system, national savings could be a conduit for large-scale capital creation for climate action.

Monetary Policy —

Monetary policy is never mentioned, so there exists an implicit assumption that monetary and fiscal policy are independent, a structural assumption that MMT would cross swords with.

However, the Act never uses the words \`monetary\`, \`money\` or even \`finance\` (Finance is a government department and easily renamed. We don't even have one of them in my State), so it feels like a minor structral weakness of the law if MMT were to be applied via this conduit.

Fairest, may be to describe Monetary and Fiscal Management as necessarily needing to constantly refer to each other, as policy tools with evolving strengths and weaknesses, but consistently steering towards a current policy platform (that the Act enforces).

As such, an encapsulation of \`sound fiscal management\` as defined by the Act without accounting for Monetary policy context would be weak tea.

- manage finaincial risks

- excessive net debt

- erosion of the tax base = erosion of the productive capacity of the economy of people, land and capital.

- commercial risks = inflation risks

Fiscal Strategy —

Part 4 of the Act is an essential road-map for any lasting political project in Australia.

If you want to make headway, you will need:

- A well defined policy of \`sound fiscal management\`, engaging with the spirit of the Act.
- long‑term objectives; what are the aims of the political project. How do the mechanisms of fiscal policy deliver these objectives?
- explain the broad priorities to the public, again and again, referencing Act policy and objectives.
- provide quantitative, evidence-based measures and tools that can be used to independently critique policy and achieving policy results.
- provide tactical commentary, differentiating between the ephemeral and the important.

## Predation

> Today, the signature of modern American capitalism is neither benign competition, nor class struggle, nor an inclusive middle-class utopia. Instead, predation has become the dominant feature—a system wherein the rich have come to feast on decaying systems built for the middle class. The predatory class is not the whole of the wealthy; it may be opposed by many others of similar wealth. But it is the defining feature, the leading force. ~ [The Predator State – Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/05/predator-state/)

## culture

## quotes

### Culture is the stuff reason is made of

"\[Culture\] as the stuff economic reason is just made of"

Many of the expressions that have appeared or gained new currency throughout 2016; Brexit, the rustbelt, baskets of deplorables, liberal elites, post-factual, point to the sheer heft underpinning contests of meaning and interpretation. The processes and dynamics signalled by such expressions should remind us of both the limits of quantitative modelling, even that powered by big, heterogeneous and interlinked datasets and algorithmic analyses, and the stakes of neglecting culture in, and for, all of its ambivalent senses. Whether culture is taken primarily to signal more or less distinguishable ways of life, meaningful practices, interpretation and representation, rhetoric, arts or civilisation or some fluid combination of all these, it should be clear that culture is doing some work that quantitative analysis is not rendering visible.

Ten years after: it’s the economy and culture, stupid! Melinda Cooper & Liz McFall <http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17530350.2016.1267026?needAccess=true&>

### hayek

To act on the belief that we possess the knowledge and the power which enable us to shape the processes of society entirely to our liking, knowledge which in fact we do not possess, is likely to make us do much harm. ~ Hayek

The recognition of the insuperable limits to his knowledge ought indeed to teach the student of society a lesson of humility which should guard him against becoming an accomplice in men's fatal striving to control society - a striving which makes him not only a tyrant over his fellows, but which may well make him the destroyer of a civilization which no brain has designed but which has grown from the free efforts of millions of individuals. ~

### What actually happens

“Values, interests, personalities, timing, circumstance and happenstance — in short, democracy — determine what actually happens”. ~ \[Banks\]

### You can never go home again

The double movement of capitalist life centrally involves the constant need to respond productively to a speculative provocation, to reconstruct reality around a new connection that cannot simply be undone and has irrevocably altered how things work (Adkins 2012). It is the distinctive strength of the neoliberal project to recognize that “you can never go home again” (Mirowski 2013: 326) and to have intuited the political uses of disturbance and provocation.

### A crisis of measure

capitalism continually works to produce and invent new foundations even as it experiences periodic crises of measure. " ~ <https://www.academia.edu/21935995/Contingency_and_Foundation_Rethinking_Money_Debt_and_Finance_after_the_Crisis?auto=download>

### Federation

It enables specialisation, and it respects the regional differences in a big continent. But it is not a neat package of powers. Tidiness is not amongst the visible strengths of a federal system. There will always be ragged edges and compromises, there will always be tensions in a federal system. There will periodically be formal or guerrilla raids across the federal-State boundaries, usually led by national leaders. ~ Blainey

## frogs

In the origin story of AI you will find Letvin and company's `What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain*` Here's what they say about their work on eyes:

"Fundamentally, it shows that the eye speaks to the brain in a language already highly organized and interpreted, instead of transmitting some more or less accurate copy of the distribution of light on the receptors."

If I were making charts for a frog, the paper suggests concentrating on charts that can express operations on:

- local sharp edges and contrast,
- edge curvature of a dark object,
- the movement of edges, and
- the local dimmings produced by movement or rapid general darkening.
