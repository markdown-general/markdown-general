:wave: Hi. I'm **Tony Day** and this is a blog, mostly intended as a Haskell journal, but I do have other stuff I may write about from time to time.

I started coding in basic on an Amstrad in the 80s, and worked my way along the usual kool-aid pipelines: basic to visual basic to excel to C++ (template meta-programming), back to C, on to matlab, perl, R, python and then Haskell. I haven't coded in anything else since 2012, web-tech aside. Since then, my skills  atrophied, I found Haskell a little bit functabulous, but mostly I got tired of refactoring across languages. So Haskell it is.

Always the hobbyist, never the professional developer (I can't pass the tests), more the hacker-artist, sometimes the procrastinator seeking sweet perfection. I self-report as a pattern recognition autist with coding as a long-lived *special interest*. Laying things like math, problem domains and chart APIs out neatly is like knitting - it calms the chaos and invents space for me to breathe it all in.

I hope you enjoy my musings.
