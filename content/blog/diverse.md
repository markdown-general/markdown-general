My trans daughter came out to me at a Haskell workshop. At the time, I
thought I was tech support but, in retrospect, she was locating a safe
space for both of us to digest the news. I helped with installs,
practised my pronouns and had a blast.

It can be very difficult to see the diversity in our community. We are
sparse; there are maybe 200k active GHC installs in the world, but we
are also flexible, global and accessible. Maybe 5% of those installs are
due to [tidal](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal), and more to
other projects like it, that didn't quite fit anywhere else, and the
opportunities they provide to create art (or code as art) on a budget.

Our family now has three Haskell coders (they are best bred). One, that
I mentioned, is now a harsh noise artist. I watch code on the screen
with a good set of ear plugs, looking for useful refactorings and
recursions to follow up on, in less frenetic contexts. Audiences heckle
applicatives "oh no, its less than, star, greater than." Another is a
roboticist in training. I've witnessed the state of robotics software
and I'm worried for the robots more than anything. As the trans-human
attain rights, one of the first will be a GHC install in their cores.
And, me, I do tech support.

Not a bad definition of tech support.

This will come as no surprise to insiders, but within the very small
circle of Haskell coders I know, the community is renown as a safe
space for the gender queer and neuro-diverse. We don't like to brag, but
tech support in Haskell has improved of late. Diversity is visible and
being amplified.

Within this context of community and respect for diversity, there has
been some recent active defence against gender and race baiting on fp
slack. Some of our community has left, and some of us never arrived
because it has never been a particularly safe space for them. Recent
posts are trolling, exclusionary and cheap, and I hope we can find a
better spot to chat about technicals.

Can we please think about this communication channel in light of the
GCR? Given our makeup, these memetic viral loads coming in can pack a
punch, and we need to develop strong and automatic immune responses.
