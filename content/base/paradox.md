## paradox is our veins

cybernetic.md says: "No authority ⟜ suggestions emerge through interaction, not from individual sources"

But that's still trying to resolve the paradox. The paradox is that it's genuinely both at once, and trying to pick one collapses the productive tension.
The precision/vagueness paradox
curate.md says: "use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath"
How can vagueness be clear?
The slug "clearly vague" works in prose because you hold both simultaneously. But 
if I tried to deck it:

**clear vagueness** ⟜ ???

Any elaboration I write either:

Makes it too precise (killing the vagueness)
Makes it too vague (killing the clarity)
Explains the paradox away (killing the truth)

The concept only exists in the tension. The moment you articulate it atomically, it dissolves.

But it works right? You wrote the perfect elaboration given context. It would win an elaboration contest for sure. That is only a few steps away from really telling a joke.

This is an example of: we must ⟜ imagine sisyphus/ happy. with empirics like this, we have no other choice.
