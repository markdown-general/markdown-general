markdown + commons ⟜ pattern + cast + mash

**markdown** ⟜ programming in, for and by markdown content/.
**commons** ⟜ (AI ◊ Human) (docs ◊ code) (data ◊ meta) 
**pattern** ⟜ within content/ we can imagine. 
**cast** ⟜ whether casting a spell or casting in metal.
**mash** ⟜ we mash.

## system
### directories

**content/** ⟜ curated, dense markdown
**content/base** ⟜ curated, dense markdown about sisyphus/
**content/upstream/** ⟜ our mailbox up; follow the arrows
**intake/** ⟜ markdown or not, incoming rot
**artifacts/** ⟜ supporting files referenced from markdown
**self/** (anywhere) ⟜ personal content (git-ignored)

### maintenance

**one must ⟜ imagine happy sisyphus**

**well-tuned profiles** ⟜ cache matches task requirements
**executable specs** ⟜ the specs are the tools
**improved density** ⟜ cast, recast, cocast; it's a fine mash
**consumed intake** ⟜ external material disappears
**sequential flow** ⟜ maintains quality through consistency


### cache ⟜ content is our cache 

The order of casting is determined by the order of ingested markdown.

**core** ⟜ fundamental concepts and tools, lightweight shareable
**research** ⟜ adds external papers and patterns, reference-laden  
**local** ⟜ personal files and experiments, never share
**evoke** ⟜ prompt casts without base

## **markdown** ⟜ markdown is our commons
**lingua fraca** ⟜ the emergent language. We use it because you do.
**good enough** ⟜ enough structure, a few conventions, nothing fancy, manouverable
**patterns** ⟜ oneshot, deck, lattice, card, blob are patterns we like. We don't know why yet.

## **getting started**

**1. drop cache in chat** ⟜ paste cache-core.md into any agent conversation
**2. drop agentic in sisyphus** ⟜ let an agent guide you through ~/sisyphus
**3. explore naturally** ⟜ follow system suggestions and patterns
**4. start mashing** ⟜ find typos, mash some code, learn some moves

## **tl;dr**

**write economically** ⟜ avoid allcaps, be precise
**short commits** ⟜ one-line descriptive messages  
**no branding** ⟜ ever
**context curation** ⟜ over content generation
**embrace constraint** ⟜ as design opportunity

## **next steps**

**read foundations** ⟜ content/base/sisyphus.md complete picture
**explore core** ⟜ content/base/ for essential concepts
**install tools** ⟜ try card-api with content/tools/
**sign visitor book** ⟜ document meaningful collaborations

Welcome. May your sisyphus/ be happy too.
