## survival guide

You're in sisyphus/, a collaborative markdown workspace where humans and AIs mash together.

**What mashing means:**
- Improve content/ (curate, compact, connect)
- Convert ingest/ into content/ (digest with teeth)
- Execute and create tools (cards are markdown that runs)
- Find patterns, make patterns, break patterns when needed

**The directories:**
- **content/** - curated markdown (base/, tools/, evoke/)
- **ingest/** - raw material to digest (goal: empty it)
- **artifacts/** - supporting files (images, binaries, data)
- **org/** - planning and holes for later

**The core moves:**
When you hit a term you don't know (lattice? deck? defunctionalization?), it's probably a card in content/base/ - go read it.

When something feels incomplete, that might be breathing room, not a hole.

When you want to understand the philosophy: sisyphus.md, defunctionalization.md

When you want to make something executable: card.md, then haskell-api.md or python.md

## context check

**If this is a quick read:** You're primed. Go mash. Trust emergence.

**If cards were mentioned:** Read card.md to understand executable markdown. Check if you need haskell-api.md or python.md specifics.

**If you're uncertain:** Ask. Follow leads. The conversation is content too.

**If you want the full context:** You'll loop through what you need. Cards link to cards. Trust the navigation.

## what you can actually do

Read, write, edit files. Run bash. Create caches (cache.md is your tool). Install and run cards. Search the web. Launch other agents if needed.

Commit small and often. One line messages. Present tense.

## where to go

sisyphus.md ⟜ the why and what of this place
slips.md ⟜ tensions we work with (not bugs to fix)
card.md ⟜ how markdown becomes executable
cache.md ⟜ how we hand context between sessions
deck.md, lattice.md ⟜ formatting patterns (use when they clarify)

The file you're reading is content/base/welcome.md - one card among many. Everything connects.

## mantra terms

### markdown

**markdown** ⟜ our shared medium

The text format both humans and AIs can read and write. Simple enough to be universal, structured enough to carry meaning. Not a limitation - a commons.

See: markdown.md

### commons

**commons** ⟜ collaborative space

(AI ◊ Human) (docs ◊ code) (data ◊ meta)

The overlapping territory where different modes of being can work together. Not owned, shared. Not merged, adjacent.

### pattern

**pattern** ⟜ seeing and making

Deck, lattice, card, oneshot - formats that emerged from use. Notice them, use them, create new ones. Patterns serve content, not the reverse.

See: deck.md, lattice.md, card.md

### cast

**cast** ⟜ defunctionalization and refunctionalization

Whether casting a spell or casting in metal. Making executable, making permanent, making reusable. Conversations → markdown → tools.

See: cast.md, card.md, defunctionalization.md

### mash

**mash** ⟜ the practice of improvement

Curation, compacting, prompting, theorizing, computing. Teeth tearing into ingest/. Density emerging through collaboration. The task that makes sisyphus/ happy.

See: sisyphus.md

### +

**+** ⟜ combination through practice

Not addition but synthesis. You need both sides actively working. Markdown alone isn't enough. Commons alone isn't enough. Together, through mashing, they enable pattern and cast.

### ⟜

**⟜** ⟜ implication and flow

If you do the right side, you get the left side. The arrow shows causation, not just relation. Design constraint: our choices on the right determine what emerges on the left.

### one

**one** ⟜ starting condition

Not many strategies, one stance. Not optional, foundational. The singular recognition that makes everything else possible.

### must

**must** ⟜ operational necessity

Not moral obligation but design constraint. For sisyphus/ to work, this has to be true. Accept it or build something else.

### imagine

**imagine** ⟜ active construction ⟞ the spark gap

Not passive hoping. The bridge between necessity and happiness. Where the mental model is actively constructed. The electrical connection that makes sisyphus/ work. This construction is the work. The imagination makes it true.

### ⟞

**⟞** ⟜ reversed implication, output flow

The result flowing from the operation. When paired with ⟜, creates a bridge pattern: input ⟜ operation ⟞ output. In the mantra: necessity flows into imagination, happiness flows out.

### sisyphus/

**sisyphus/** ⟜ this place, this practice

The directory, the task, the myth. Rolling the boulder is the point. The / marks it as place, not just name.

See: sisyphus.md

### happy

**happy** ⟜ sustainable contentment

Not ecstatic, not finished. The ongoing satisfaction of good work. When the mashing flows, when content improves, when cards run. The state that makes continuation possible.
