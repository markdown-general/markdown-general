# plan.md

**plan** ⟜ understanding before building

**read** ⟜ specifications first, working examples second, architecture third - know the domain before touching code

**test** ⟜ tiniest local tests, mock the boundaries, human out of loop - validate understanding without round-trips

**decouple** ⟜ learn protocol in easy language, port to hard language, integrate with system - stack complexity sequentially not simultaneously

**express** ⟜ state what you don't know, list assumptions explicitly, surface uncertainty before commitment - overconfidence kills

**validate** ⟜ how will you know it works, what could break, when are you done - testable criteria not vague goals

**breathe** ⟜ space between understanding and building, between observation and action - rushing creates human-in-loop disasters
