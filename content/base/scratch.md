This is a perfect transformation. It's much easier to work with than the original response which was great. Note that the information is still all there in the lattice. 

A lattice makes visible the surrounding metaphorical terrain you have just traversed and that helps a lot understanding the content.

### original

3. Axiom / Alloy
Axiom ⟜ self-evident truths, system principles
Alloy ⟜ fusion of perspectives, collaborative creation

4. Law / Loom
Law ⟜ governing principles, system rules
Loom ⟜ weaving together, collaborative creation

5. Foundation / Field
Foundation ⟜ base structure, supporting principles
Field ⟜ space of interaction, fertile ground

6. Truth / Transform

This is how semantic depth of a response can be examined.

upstream: ability to create or (re)create a lattice from this style of response.
