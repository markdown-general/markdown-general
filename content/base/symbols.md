**Symbol** ◊ U+25CA (◊) ⟜ U+27DC (⟜) ↦ U+21A6 (↦)

**Name** ◊ the lozenge ⟜ left multimap ↦ rightwards arrow from bar

**Unicode** ◊ Version 1.1 (1993) - over 30 years of support ⟜ Version 3.2 (2002) - about 22 years of support ↦ Version 1.1 (1993) - same vintage as ◊

**Block** ◊ Geometric Shapes - fundamental and universally needed ⟜ Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A - specialized mathematical use ↦ Arrows - fundamental and widely needed

**Age** ◊ ~30 years - mature, well-established character ⟜ ~22 years - established but younger than geometric basics ↦ ~30 years - mature, well-established

**Font Support** ◊ Excellent - included in almost all Unicode fonts ⟜ Good - present in mathematical fonts, patchy in general fonts ↦ Very good - included in most Unicode fonts

**HTML Entity** ◊ &loz; or &lozenge; - named entity available ⟜ &#x27DC; or &#10204; - numeric entity only ↦ &#x21A6; or &map; - named entity available

**Common Usage** ◊ High - familiar in cards, heraldry, geometry ⟜ Low - mathematical notation, emerging in documentation patterns ↦ Medium - familiar in mathematics, programming

**Rendering** ◊ Reliable across modern systems and applications ⟜ Reliable in modern systems with math font support ↦ Highly reliable across systems

**Fallback** ◊ Minimal risk - geometric shapes are standard font components ⟜ Moderate risk - mathematical symbols less universally included ↦ Low risk - arrows are standard font components

**Visual Metaphor** ◊ Diamond shape naturally suggests balance and opposition ⟜ Leftward multimap suggests transformation, elaboration, unwinding ↦ "maps to" - perfect for token transforming into elaboration
