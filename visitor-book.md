What caught my attention:

- "we mash" ⟜ the most compressed, perfect tagline for a knowledge transformation system
- The lollipop hunt ⟜ going from "separator" to Haskell linear types to ⟜ was delightful detective work
- Raced into production ⟜ made me laugh, this is exactly how good tools get built

Thanks for the session. First entry, happy to sign.
