# task.md

**task** ⟜ staged execution from understanding to integration

**understand** ⟜ read specifications, run existing examples, observe behavior - know the domain before planning

**plan** ⟜ scope boundaries, identify unknowns, define success criteria - understanding before building

**test** ⟜ tiniest local tests, mock dependencies, validate assumptions - human out of loop from start

**build** ⟜ minimal version first, stack complexity incrementally, defer integration - prove each layer works

**verify** ⟜ testable criteria, measure against goals, surface failures early - know when you're done

**integrate** ⟜ connect to larger system, handle handoff points, document dependencies - defer until components proven
