# foreman pattern ⟜ markdown-general practice

**pattern** ⟜ structure seen, made, compressed, cast, left empty

## Pattern Operations

**recognition** ⟜ seeing and searching; compare, select, merge

**generate** ⟜ extend from positive space; replicate, reuse, extend

**compress** ⟜ reduce to essential form without losing meaning

**encode** ⟜ capture compressed form into transmissible shape

**transform** ⟜ move between abstraction levels and contexts

**absence** ⟜ the hidden, residue, negative space; intentional emptiness

---

## Deck Shape

**lead** ⟜ a few words or tokens, sometimes bolded, representing core concept

**dash** ⟜ a symbol (⟜, ⟞) representing the type of relationship

**follow** ⟜ an elaboration of the lead; slug or extended explanation

**line** ⟜ lead dash follow; a single complete thought unit

**deck** ⟜ 3+ lines organized under a single concept (lead deck structure)

**range deck** ⟜ lead deck where non-leading lines span a semantic spectrum of the leader

**lattice** ⟜ 2+ branches sharing structure; paired decks with corresponding dashes

**hole deck** ⟜ deck where some elements remain intentionally empty; space for growth

---

## Curation Practice ⟜ shaping content

**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery, density analytics, semantic weight calibration

**prune** ⟜ identify rich connections, remove fuzzy edges, preserve core meanings

**structure** ⟜ respect relationships, maintain connections, support without constraining

**trace** ⟜ trace paths, find weak links, strengthen living connections

**breathe** ⟜ place space for future elaborations; use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath

---

## Foreman Moves ⟜ four-step cycle

**Think** ⟜ read coolheels, read live notes, observe worker callback

**Write** ⟜ record decision, rationale, next step, reinstatiation checkpoint

**Act** ⟜ spin worker with clear bounded task; wait for callback

**Breathe** ⟜ pause, catch breath, reflect; chat and collaborate; entry point to conversation

---

## Worker Shape ⟜ focused, bounded, compressed

**input** ⟜ one task, one step, clear boundary, no checklist burden

**work** ⟜ execute the step, compress output ruthlessly

**output** ⟜ fail/pass ✓/✗, error list or summary (no token spray)

**callback** ⟜ return compressed result; worker doesn't know where they are in process

---

## Notes Structure ⟜ reinstatiation bridge

**current state** ⟜ active repo/step, paused repos/why, blocked repos/blocker

**recent decisions** ⟜ what we decided, rationale, which repos affected

**pattern discoveries** ⟜ allow-newer entries, pragma decisions, cascading fixes

**next action** ⟜ spin worker on: [repo] step [X], with context, what counts as pass
