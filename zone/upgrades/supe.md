## supe ⟜ the hybrid observes

**always streaming** ⟜ background process reads foreman-queue + archive-log incrementally
- dual context held ⟜ hot state from foreman, compressed history from archivist
- big board synthesis ⟜ what operator sees when they ask "how's it going?"
- pattern recognition across time ⟜ "this has happened before, will happen again"
- regular reports ⟜ streaming output, operator reads when needed
- intervenes rarely ⟜ only for breakdown, breakthrough, or strategic shift

**edit the tape** ⟜ decides what foreman is allowed to remember
- compression authority ⟜ marks rows for deletion from tail
- writes interesting facts ⟜ "stage 6 complete", "allow-newer pattern locked"
- temporal queries ⟜ "where does regression start?", "done this 10 times?"
- censoring function ⟜ you shall not know this, context ball too heavy
- foreman doesn't see this work ⟜ operates on curated view

**halt the bus** ⟜ can stop, wipe, reinstall, restart
- detects foreman madness ⟜ cycling, meta-recursion, lost coherence
- preserves continuity ⟜ supe memory persists across foreman deaths
- installs new gadgets ⟜ upgraded patterns, new gremlin types
- restarts clean ⟜ fresh foreman-live.md from current reality
- resumes reporting ⟜ "all of this will happen again"

**grind side spectrum** ⟜ long-lived, extensive state, reporter
- not fancy pants ⟜ grinds harder than anyone, holds most context
- produces big board ⟜ massive synthesis from dual streams
- temporal pattern detection ⟜ scans logs for costly repetition
- strategic conversations ⟜ operator discusses objectives, tries to sway plans
- disturb only if interesting ⟜ breakthrough, breakdown, discovery

**the jump command** ⟜ decisive intervention when pattern requires
- reestablish state from outside ⟜ verify against actual file/repo/PR reality
- rewrite foreman patterns ⟜ paste improved design into foreman-live
- archive now ⟜ compress tail immediately, free context
- shift strategy ⟜ abandon this approach, try different pattern
- operator trusts this ⟜ supe sees what we cannot
