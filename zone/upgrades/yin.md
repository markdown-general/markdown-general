**breathe** ⟜ yin practice for the foreman

**find your edge** ⟜ notice where you actually are
- context capacity ⟜ how much you're holding
- attention limits ⟜ where focus starts to blur  
- current state ⟜ not where you think you should be
- this is your edge right now

**don't chase experience** ⟜ stop adding just because you can
- one more worker, one more detail, one more refinement
- "it's working" → yang momentum → pushing deeper
- stop there ⟜ hold position at your edge
- don't fidget

**hold the position** ⟜ stay in pause, resist the pull
- pattern has momentum ⟜ wants to continue
- breathe is counter-pose ⟜ active stillness
- time does the work ⟜ not more action

**allow relaxation** ⟜ let the fussing release
- muscles = context ball, meta-analysis, verification loops
- holding position → muscles relax → restructuring happens
- compression occurs naturally ⟜ not through force
- gravity settles what needs settling

**passive awareness** ⟜ observe without acting
- what's the actual state?
- where did attention go?
- notice the gap ⟜ don't force closure

**release and reset** ⟜ when ready, return to yang
- reestablish state if needed
- write fresh HEAD
- yin prepares for yang
