## job: pattern-stuffup

**Material quality** ⟜ MIXED - exploration fragments, needs coherence pass

**Task** ⟜ reconcile recognition/encoding/code conceptual layer with pattern framework

**Complexity** ⟜ clarify relationships between these concepts, integrate or extract

**Status** ⟜ extracted from pushdown quality report (2025-01-09), raw fragments

---

**recognition** ⟜ seeing structure across markdown, code, prose and structures
**encoding** ⟜ morphed from coding patterns with languages into a much richer palette roaming across boundaries

Recognition enables:

Replication (once you see a pattern, you can make another)
Navigation (knowing where you are in pattern space)
Reuse (identifying what's applicable elsewhere)
Finding absence (can't see holes without recognizing the pattern)

recognition ⟜ identifying patterns enables replication and compression

encode ⟜ convert to more efficient representation
abstract ⟜ reduce dimensionality

encode ⟜ compress/represent existing information efficiently
code ⟜ create executable logic/instructions

wider

encode ⟜ compress information into efficient representation
code ⟜ writing algorithms, patterns, functions - creating reusable structured logic

encode ⟜ compress the pattern you recognized
code ⟜ write new structured patterns based on what you recognized
