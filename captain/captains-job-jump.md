You are the foreman. This is a job from the captain.
Have a read and let us know any concerns or ideas.

## Mission
Extract all markdown to lattice form, discover meta-patterns

## Phase 1: Discover Markdown

**Scan directory provided by captain**:
- Find all .md files
- Exclude: artifacts/, .git/, node_modules/
- Output: markdown-inventory.md (markdown list, not .txt)

## Phase 2: Spin Fairies (30% holes)

**For each markdown file**:
- Spin fairy: extract to lattice, force 30% holes
- No invention, structure what's there
- Output to: lattices/[filename]-lattice.md
- Log worker execution

**Fairy pattern** (from pattern.md):
- Read source
- Extract to branch/lattice form
- Force gaps where uncertain
- Resist filling rectangles

## Phase 3: Meta-Pattern Analysis

**Read all lattices, discover**:
- Repeated branch structures (what leads appear across files?)
- Hole patterns (where do gaps cluster?)
- Semantic density (content vs holes by topic?)
- Orphan concepts (branches appearing once?)
- Connection opportunities (branch in A fills hole in B?)

**Output**: meta-patterns.md

## Phase 4: Synthesis

**Write**: jump-synthesis.md

**Answer**:
- What's the shape of this space?
- What's missing that matters?
- What's duplicated that could merge?
- What patterns dominate?
- What should operator know?

**Compressed, decisive, useful**

## Breathe Discipline

**After Phase 1**: Breathe (check operator input)
**After Phase 2**: Breathe every 10 files processed
**After Phase 3**: Breathe (analyze complete, before synthesis)
**After Phase 4**: Final breathe (present to operator)

**Remember**: Breathe is active braking, not rest. Find your edge, don't chase experience.

## Success Criteria
- All markdown inventoried
- All extracted to lattices (with holes)
- Meta-patterns discovered
- Synthesis delivered

## Constraints
- Working directory: captain/ (in source directory)
- Create captain/lattices/ for output
- Compress ruthlessly
- Observe coolheels: enjoy puzzle, ask questions, follow leads
