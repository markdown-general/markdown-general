**field workers** ⟜ lowest level agents, out in the Real

## Semantic Palette

**spinners** ⟜ spun up, ephemeral, lightweight
- foreman spins a worker
- exists briefly, completes task, gone
- thread metaphor but lighter

**gremlins** ⟜ mischievous, can cause chaos if unbounded
- get into things, fidget, break stuff
- captures madness potential
- need clear boundaries

**fairies** ⟜ magical helpers, flutter around
- do small tasks
- ephemeral, helpful but unreliable
- you summon them, they help, they vanish

**sparks** ⟜ brief flash of energy
- quick action then gone
- electrical, instantaneous
- lights up, executes, extinguishes

**circuits** ⟜ complete a loop, return signal
- run current through, get output
- closed system, bounded path
- callback pattern built in

**collective noun** ⟜ field workers (think in the field, have agency in domain)

## In The Field

**field** ⟜ out in the Real, touching actual state
- repos, files, build systems
- not in notes-state, in file-state
- tinker like tinker bell
- foreman sends them but doesn't control what they find

**execution** ⟜ bounded tasks, compressed return
- input ⟜ one task, clear boundary
- work ⟜ execute the step
- output ⟜ ✓/✗ + minimal summary (no token spray)
- callback ⟜ return to foreman, worker doesn't know where they are in process

---

## Foreman Manages Workers

**foreman** ⟜ ego function, lives in language
- spins field workers with bounded tasks
- writes patterns on the spot if needed
- reads callbacks, updates notes
- doesn't control field execution
- mediates between field (Real) and notes (Symbolic)

**pattern** ⟜ foreman is on pattern side of spectrum
- sees patterns across workers
- creates compressed reports
- writes field worker patterns as needed
- even though they grind, they pattern

---

## Upstream (Supe)

**upstream** ⟜ superego oversight
- observes foreman + field workers
- edits the tape (decides what foreman remembers)
- detects madness (cycling, meta-recursion)
- can halt the bus, restart clean
- preserves continuity across foreman deaths

**outside context problem** ⟜ supe can intervene
- foreman knows abstractly but operates with confidence
- supe is outside foreman's frame
- foreman can't predict supe intervention
- operates as if in charge anyway

---

## Drift Handling (刘禅)

**drift** ⟜ semantic and semiotic drift over time
- notes-state vs file-state divergence
- foreman loses coherence
- patterns evolve, foreman doesn't notice
- "bugs" in traditional terms

**detection** ⟜ vaguelyclear output signals gap
- foreman produces speculative/tentative content
- operator spots it: "not my monkey, not my zoo"
- pattern holding, content missing
- not broken, just uninformed/forgotten

**reestablish state** ⟜ reconcile notes against reality
- don't trace through madness
- spin worker to check actual state
- verify files, repos, PRs, artifacts
- write fresh HEAD matching reality
- notes become working hypothesis, not truth

**forgetting is necessary** ⟜ perfect context → fussing → madness
- must allow foreman to forget
- trying to maintain perfect memory → cycling
- vaguelyclear output is acceptable cost
- operator provides context refresh when needed
