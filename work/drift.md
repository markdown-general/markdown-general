# drift

**drift** ⟜ semantic and semiotic drift over time

## What Drift Is

**drift** ⟜ notes-state vs file-state divergence
- yin loses coherence
- patterns evolve, yin doesn't notice
- "bugs" in traditional terms
- semantic mutation as system operates

## Detection

**vaguelyclear output** ⟜ signals gap without breaking
- foreman produces speculative/tentative content
- operator spots it: "not my monkey, not my zoo"
- pattern holding, content missing
- not broken, just uninformed/forgotten

## Recovery

**reestablish state** ⟜ reconcile notes against reality
- don't trace through madness
- spin worker to check actual state
- verify files, repos, PRs, artifacts
- write fresh HEAD matching reality
- notes become working hypothesis, not truth

**forgetting is necessary** ⟜ perfect context → fussing → madness
- must allow yin to forget
- trying to maintain perfect memory → cycling
- vaguelyclear output is acceptable cost
- operator provides context refresh when needed

Fix it now, send a note upstream, write on a card, make a plan for next time.
