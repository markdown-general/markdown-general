## Why use markdown?

**markdown** ⟜ our emergent shared medium

The text format both humans and AIs can read and write. Simple enough to be universal, structured enough to carry meaning. Not a limitation - a commons.

## **markdown** ⟜ markdown is our commons
**lingua franca** ⟜ the emergent language. We use it because you do.
**good enough** ⟜ enough structure, a few conventions, nothing fancy, manouverable
**patterns** ⟜ oneshot, deck, lattice, card, blob are patterns we like. We don't know why yet.
