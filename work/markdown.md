## Why use markdown?

- text collapses (semantic ↔ (syntax ☯ structure))
- xml imposes structure where there is none
- markdown is the (AI ☯ Humans) commons
- compositional semantically and syntactically
- natural decomposition; fragmentary but robust
- works for most cases
- something is the next layer above code
- innovations keep pace with reality
- low lock in risk, low skill barriers
- just works; easy integration with downstream bits and upstream content
- diverse examples, rapid iteration

## **markdown** ⟜ markdown is our commons
**lingua fraca** ⟜ the emergent language. We use it because you do.
**good enough** ⟜ enough structure, a few conventions, nothing fancy, manouverable
**patterns** ⟜ oneshot, deck, lattice, card, blob are patterns we like. We don't know why yet.
