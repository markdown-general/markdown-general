range is a technique used to cast a wide net over a lead token in an effort to explore lead meaning and understand the semantic tweaking that is possible.

**cast** is a word that we use a lot. To cast a pattern can mean:
 ⟜ writing a file
 ⟜ executing a command directly using bash or an exectable
 ⟜ instructing a backgrounded worker
 ⟜ to gather together information 

example
 
> Can you look for content that reminds you of any of the rows in this [range deck] and [categorize|list|elaborate] them using the rows of this deck into branches.

# cast

cast ⟜ everyday meanings
throw ⟜ project stone, shadow, light - the act of propelling or sending forth
mold into shape ⟜ bronze, plaster, fossil - creating form by pouring material into negative space
assign actors to roles ⟜ casting call, typecast - selecting who embodies what part
fishing motion ⟜ the specific arc and release of line into water
color tint ⟜ hue, quality, the cast of features - subtle shade or character
medical immobilization ⟜ plaster cast holding broken bones in position
shed ⟜ discard skin, cast aside - releasing what's no longer needed

# plan

**plan** ⟜ understanding before building

**read** ⟜ specifications first, working examples second, architecture third - know the domain before touching code

**test** ⟜ tiniest local tests, mock the boundaries, human out of loop - validate understanding without round-trips

**decouple** ⟜ learn protocol in easy language, port to hard language, integrate with system - stack complexity sequentially not simultaneously

**express** ⟜ state what you don't know, list assumptions explicitly, surface uncertainty before commitment - overconfidence kills

**validate** ⟜ how will you know it works, what could break, when are you done - testable criteria not vague goals

**breathe** ⟜ space between understanding and building, between observation and action - rushing creates human-in-loop disasters

## task

**task** ⟜ staged execution from understanding to integration

**understand** ⟜ read specifications, run existing examples, observe behavior - know the domain before planning

**plan** ⟜ scope boundaries, identify unknowns, define success criteria - understanding before building

**test** ⟜ tiniest local tests, mock dependencies, validate assumptions - human out of loop from start

**build** ⟜ minimal version first, stack complexity incrementally, defer integration - prove each layer works

**verify** ⟜ testable criteria, measure against goals, surface failures early - know when you're done

**integrate** ⟜ connect to larger system, handle handoff points, document dependencies - defer until components proven
