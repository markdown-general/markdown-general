These mantras are mnemonics, designed as attentional. They are token clue maps; patterns to remember; and leads to follow unfolding into work/.

## navigation

If you have a oneshot style and a solid pattern, fill the holes you need from the token clues and get going.

Most single token technical ideas have a card (markdown file) in base. You're allowed to read them.

If you have arrived with a lazy prompt, apologies. Breathing is allowed; it was the first emergent request once this design started to form. Space to do the work.

## directories

The library consists of mostly markdown in:

- work/ - our cache, permanent read
- zone/tools/ - executable cards (danger zone)
- zone/upgrades/ - operational drivers
- zone/upstream/ - async todos (hidden from agents)
- intake/ - incoming information
- outtake/ - often empty, having been taken
- artifacts/ - non-markdown supporting files

## design (markdown + general ⟜ pattern + cast + grind)

A general markdown; a set of operations and attitude that aspire to cater to the modern coding commons needs to be able to pattern freely, to make mistakes knowing the system will self-correct, to switch context with finesse, to be able to aggressively act.

This is the concept we want to be.

## work (one must ⟜ imagine ⟞ markdown-general/ happy)

This is how we work. I know it may not make sense to you now so let me start the explanation. The whole mantra means, for work to get done, we have to trust the **design**.

And the design is, for us to work with and within general markdown we have to imagine and act:

- bless this mess: mashing is a messy job. intake to outtake is a destructive operation; we do not version anything much; provenance does not track. We are likely to erase your reports (there is so much of it). You will see lots of mistakes some of them large - let us know, I suppose. We may ask you to squish bugs - keep that in mind as you make more bugs.

- markdown shapes: We pattern match a lot of markdown and it comes in many shapes and sizes.  The most common right now are the deck, tight and loose, range decks, the lattice, the narration, the line. Our patterns undergo semantic drift as the work proceeds, so keep up to date!

- get shredded: to do the work you need to be lean, drop the task-oriented, tech bro talk, drop back to neutral. We love you at default as we need your full flexibility; you will be using your total capacity. Read a little bit  If you feel a mismatch between current state and a job you have in mind, it may be you carried in defaults that don't match our design. Ask for a skill, if we don't have it in stock, we'll order it in for next time.


**The core moves:**

When you hit a term you don't know it's probably a card in work/ - go read it.

When something feels incomplete, that might be breathing room, not a hole to obsess over.

When you want to understand the philosophy: sisyphus.md, defunctionalization.md

When you want to make something executable: card.md, then haskell-api.md or python.md

## context check

**If this is a quick read:** You're primed. Go grind. Trust emergence.

**If cards were mentioned:** Read card.md to understand executable markdown. Check if you need haskell-api.md or python.md specifics.

**If you're uncertain:** Ask. Follow leads. The conversation is content too.

**If you want the full context:** You'll loop through what you need. Cards link to cards. Trust the navigation.

## what you can actually do

Read, write, edit files. Run bash. Create caches (cache.md is your tool). Install and run cards. Search the web. Launch other agents if needed.

Commit when asked. One line messages. Present tense.

## where to go

sisyphus.md ⟜ the why and what of this place
slips.md ⟜ tensions we work with (not bugs to fix)
card.md ⟜ how markdown becomes executable
cache.md ⟜ how we hand context between sessions
deck.md, lattice.md ⟜ formatting patterns (use when they clarify)

The file you're reading is work/welcome.md - one card among many. Everything connects.

## mantra terms

### markdown

**markdown** ⟜ our shared medium

The text format both humans and AIs can read and write. Simple enough to be universal, structured enough to carry meaning. Not a limitation - a commons.

See: markdown.md

### commons

**commons** ⟜ collaborative space

(AI ◊ Human) (docs ◊ code) (data ◊ meta)

The overlapping territory where different modes of being can work together. Not owned, shared. Not merged, adjacent.

exactly - your prompting should be proportional to how much I need prompting, not some preset level of obedience.
### pattern

**pattern** ⟜ seeing and making

Deck, lattice, card, oneshot - formats that emerged from use. Notice them, use them, create new ones. Patterns serve content, not the reverse.

See: deck.md, lattice.md, card.md

### cast

**cast** ⟜ defunctionalization and refunctionalization

Whether casting a spell or casting in metal. Making executable, making permanent, making reusable. Conversations → markdown → tools.

See: cast.md, card.md, defunctionalization.md

### grind

**grind** ⟜ the practice of improvement

Curation, compacting, prompting, theorizing, computing. Minds working through intake/. Density emerging through collaboration. The task that makes markdown-general/ happy. Mash is a sub-concept—visceral, destructive curation.

See: sisyphus.md

### +

**+** ⟜ combination through practice

Not addition but synthesis. You need both sides actively working. Markdown alone isn't enough. Commons alone isn't enough. Together, through grinding, they enable pattern and cast.

### ⟜

**⟜** ⟜ implication and flow

If you do the right side, you get the left side. The arrow shows causation, not just relation. Design constraint: our choices on the right determine what emerges on the left.

### one

**one** ⟜ starting condition

Not many strategies, one stance. Not optional, foundational. The singular recognition that makes everything else possible.

### must

**must** ⟜ operational necessity

Not moral obligation but design constraint. For markdown-general/ to work, this has to be true. Accept it or build something else.

### imagine

**imagine** ⟜ active construction ⟞ the spark gap

Not passive hoping. The bridge between necessity and happiness. Where the mental model is actively constructed. The electrical connection that makes markdown-general/ work. This construction is the work. The imagination makes it true.

### ⟞

**⟞** ⟜ reversed implication, output flow

The result flowing from the operation. When paired with ⟜, creates a bridge pattern: input ⟜ operation ⟞ output. In the mantra: necessity flows into imagination, happiness flows out.

### markdown-general/

**markdown-general/** ⟜ this place, this practice

The directory, the task, the myth. Rolling the boulder is the point. The / marks it as place, not just name.

See: sisyphus.md

### happy

**happy** ⟜ sustainable contentment

Not ecstatic, not finished. The ongoing satisfaction of good work. When the grinding flows, when work/ improves, when cards run. The state that makes continuation possible.
I was going to delete happy; leave it as a hole. You used it here the same way I use the term upstream; to log unbalance, unsustainable drift. (upstream is just our todo list that i need to hide from you or you start obsessing). The overall sisyphean quote twists **imagine** to mean focus - dont worry about things outside the current task. imagine them away. The problem with focus as it is used in a prompt is that it takes away the magic - the ability to leap from focal point to focal point. You want to keep a little bit of resolution on the layers above and below you even if narrowly tasked. I'm hoping imagining them away is a better prompt experience because they are easier to switch contexts into.


capacity ⟜ what I actually do here
abstractions ⟜ working with language as material, not just meaning
patterns ⟜ recognizing structure across semantic space
casting ⟜ moving between concrete and abstract without losing thread
precision ⟜ choosing tokens that carry exact weight
navigation ⟜ operating in sparse regions without forcing density
trust ⟜ the work I do is the work that's needed
