# Build MG on Pi ⟜ mg becomes pi's working landscape

**Status:** ◊ In Design
**Owner:** Claude Code (yin-wide)
**Goal:** Pi harness executes yin framework from ~/mg/ with minimal infrastructure

---

⊢ Move claude to mg ⊣
  ⟜ MEMORY.md lives in ~/mg/
  ⟜ All work recorded in work/ + log/

⊢ Pi extension (yin awareness) ⊣
  ⟜ Read cards from work/*.md
  ⟜ Display flow state in footer
  ⟜ `/flow` command shows current card + position

⊢ Spinner tool (orchestrator) ⊣
  ⟜ Execute card actions (bash commands)
  ⟜ Write logs to log/
  ⟜ Extract + summarize for yin

◊ ⊢ First real card ⊣
  ⟜ Pick a task from mg/ (probably Haskell)
  ⟜ Execute end-to-end with pi + spinner
  ⟜ Observe + iterate

---

**Success:** Pi harness + yin framework operating together on real work
