## artifacts

This is a pooled non-markdown artifacts directory, for bits and bobs that markdown may refer and link to, so that they may continue to refer and link to when they are in content/.

- Supporting files referenced from markdown content
- Images, PDFs, code files, data files
- Cross-referenced from markdown
- build directories (see zone/tools/haskell-api.md and python.md)
- executables (artifacts/bin should be in $PATH)
