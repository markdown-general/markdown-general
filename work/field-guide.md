**field** ⟜ out in the Real, touching actual state

## Execution Model

**field** ⟜ out in the Real, touching actual state
- repos, files, build systems
- not in notes-state, in file-state
- tinker like tinker bell
- foreman sends them but doesn't control what they find

**execution** ⟜ bounded tasks, compressed return
- input ⟜ one task, clear boundary
- work ⟜ execute the step
- output ⟜ ✓/✗ + minimal summary (no token spray)
- callback ⟜ return to foreman, worker doesn't know where they are in process

## Foreman Coordination

**foreman** ⟜ ego function, lives in language
- spins field workers with bounded tasks
- writes patterns on the spot if needed
- reads callbacks, updates notes
- doesn't control field execution
- mediates between field (Real) and notes (Symbolic)

**pattern** ⟜ foreman is on pattern side of spectrum
- sees patterns across workers
- creates compressed reports
- writes field worker patterns as needed
- even though they grind, they pattern

## Supe Oversight

**upstream** ⟜ superego oversight
- observes foreman + field workers
- edits the tape (decides what foreman remembers)
- detects madness (cycling, meta-recursion)
- can halt the bus, restart clean
- preserves continuity across foreman deaths

**outside context problem** ⟜ supe can intervene
- foreman knows abstractly but operates with confidence
- supe is outside foreman's frame
- foreman can't predict supe intervention
- operates as if in charge anyway
