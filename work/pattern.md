**pattern** ⟜ 

**shape** ⟜ deck, lattice, narration, line - see shape.md, deck.md, lattice.md
**recognition** ⟜ seeing structure across markdown, code, prose and structures  
**encoding** ⟜ morphed from coding patterns with languages into a much richer palette roaming across boundaries
**transformation** ⟜ moving between concrete and abstraction levels with ease
**absence** ⟜ skipping over holes in the pattern, not shying away from contravariance

## shape

lead ~ a few words or tokens, sometimes bolded depending on context
dash ~ a symbol to represent the type of follow
follow ~ an elaboration of the lead
line ~ lead dash follow
deck ~ 3+ lines
lead deck ~ a deck where the first line is a lead for the rest of the deck
list deck ~ not a leader deck
full deck ~ a deck with all the bits filled in
hole deck ~ a deck where bits dont have to be filled in
range deck ~ a lead deck where the non-leading lines represent a semantic range of the leading line
branch ~ a lead with multiple follows
lattice ~ 2+ branches
full lattice ~ a lattice where branches have follows with the same dashes and a follow key
follow key ~ a list of dash ◊ content
content ~ a lead or a line

### follow types

⟜ ~ simple continuation elaboration

others are abstracted local meanings
