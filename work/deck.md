# deck.md

Here is a deck that we will use for illustration:

```
**curate** ⟜ shaping content
**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery
**prune** ⟜ cutting old branches
```

## glossary

Components of a deck

**concept**: A representative token of the entire deck (e.g., "**curate**")

**lead**: A representative token for a single line, typically at the start (e.g., "**sculpt**")

**dash**: The general symbol (⟜, ⟞) used to connect a lead and an elab.

**slug**: A short elaboration of a lead. Example: "cutting old branches"

**line**: A line consisting of a lead + dash + slug

**leader**: The leading line of a deck. Example: "**curate** ⟜ shaping content"


**deck**: A structure containing a leader and multiple lines. Example:

```
**curate** ⟜ shaping content  [lead line]
**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery  [line]
**prune** ⟜ cutting old branches  [line]
```

**lattice**: A structure where corresponding elements from two decks are paired using different dashes. Example:
```
**Curation as a River** ⟜ shaping content ⟞ content as landscape carved by river flow
**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery... ⟞ removing surface layers to reveal bedrock form
```

## transforming to decks

List form:

```markdown
- Experimental knowledge undergoing mashing.
- Rough thinking, wild experiments
- AI or human authorship doesn't matter
- Safe space to try things without preserving them
- Gets challenged, replaced, evolved
```

Deck form:

```markdown
- **Experimental knowledge** ⟜ undergoing mashing.
- **Rough thinking** ⟜ wild experiments in various states
- **Authorship agnostic** ⟜ AI or human contributions treated equally
- **Safe space** ⟜ try tools without obligation to preserve
- **Gets challenged** ⟜ replaced and evolved continuously
```

### lead selection

Extract the core concept before the sentence continues. Could be 1 word, could be 3, depends on the semantic boundary.

**Good tokens:**
- **Flatten structure** (2 words, complete concept)
- **Strip** (1 word, clear action)
- **Defunctionalize** (1 word, technical term)
- **Transform aggressively** (2 words, manner + action)
  
### Deck Size

**Target:** 3-6 lines per deck
- Too few (<3): Probably not worth deck formatting
- Too many (>8): Consider splitting into multiple sections

A deck should be scannable at a glance - the bolded tokens create a visual outline of key concepts.
    

### a tight deck

A tight deck has all the components filled in.

A loose deck can have one or more items missing. A loose deck is still a deck and doesn't have to be filled in.

### a range deck

This is an example of a range deck. We place it in fence blocks to deemphasize the styling features employed.

```
**curate** ⟜ shaping content

**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery, density analytics, semantic weight calibration

**prune** ⟜ identify rich connections, remove fuzzy edges, preserve core meanings

**structure** ⟜ respect structure, preserve relationships

**trace** ⟜ trace paths, find loose ends, strengthen living connections

**breathe** ⟜ place space for future elaborations. use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath.
```

Here's why the curate deck is a range deck:

**tight deck***: All the components are present. 

**The Lead Line**: **curate** ⟜ shaping content (establishes the semantic territory)

**The Range Coverage**:
- **sculpt** → technical precision (sparse graph surgery, density analysis)
- **prune** → connection refinement (rich connections, remove fuzzy edges)  
- **structure** → relationship maintenance (respect structure, preserve relationships)
- **trace** → path exploration (trace paths, find loose ends)
- **breathe** → intentional emptiness (space for future elaborations)

Together, these five approaches cover the full semantic range of "shaping content" - from technical analysis to organic growth, from precision to spaciousness. Each leader points to a different facet of curation, creating a comprehensive exploration rather than a narrow definition.

## combining narrative and decks

**narrative to deck** ⟜ combining a narrative into the shape of another deck.

This transformation example shows how we used the shape of the curate deck to construct a water metaphor deck. Since the starting narrative had no hanging content, neither elaboration nor pruning occurred, making this a lossless transformation where the semantic relationships were preserved exactly as they appeared in the original narrative.

water metaphor narrative:

```
trace ⟜ follows the established pathways - like water finding its course through existing channels prune ⟜ removes dead ends and overgrown branches structure ⟜ ensures safe and sound support breathe ⟜ leaves room for new tributaries to form naturally
```

curate deck:

```
**curate** ⟜ shaping content


**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery, density analytics, semantic weight calibration

**prune** ⟜ identify rich connections, remove fuzzy edges, preserve core meanings

**structure** ⟜ respect structure, preserve relationships

**trace** ⟜ trace paths, find loose ends, strengthen living connections

**breathe** ⟜ place space for future elaborations. use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath.
```

### unadorned deck

Without any elaboration, the narrative in deck form looks like:

**water metaphor** ⟜

sculpt ⟜

prune ⟜ removes dead ends and overgrown branches

structure ⟜ ensures safe and sound support

trace ⟜ follows the established pathways - like water finding its course through existing channels

breathe ⟜ leaves room for new tributaries to form naturally


### elaboration of a deck

Let's make a range deck via elaboration. Note that, in this elab, the main drift was actually the lead, and this is common. We are anchoring the elaboration on the curate deck shape (the lead for each main row) which is not touched. sculpt is filled in (it had a junk slug) and a few clunky edges are knocked off.


river metaphor ⟜ content as landscape carved by river flow


sculpt ⟜ removing surface layers to reveal bedrock form

prune ⟜ clears debris and deadwood, keeping the channel clear

structure ⟜ creates banks that guide without constraining the current

trace ⟜ follows established pathways - navigating with the flow

breathe ⟜ leaves room for new tributaries to form naturally

## a lattice

We can combine two decks with similar shape into a lattice. Here is an example, formed from the curate deck and the (renamed) river metaphor deck.

**Curation as a River** ⟜ shaping content ⟞ content as landscape carved by river flow

**sculpt** ⟜ find form with sparse graph surgery, density analytics, semantic weight calibration ⟞ removing surface layers to reveal bedrock form

**prune** ⟜ identify rich connections, remove fuzzy edges, preserve core meanings ⟞ clears debris and deadwood, keeping the channel clear

**structure** ⟜ respect structure, preserve relationships ⟞ creates banks that guide without constraining the current

**trace** ⟜ trace paths, find loose ends, strengthen living connections ⟞ follows established pathways - navigating with the flow

**breathe** ⟜ place space for future elaborations. use clearly vague gap words as semantic breath ⟞ leaves room for new tributaries to form naturally
