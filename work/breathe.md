**breathe** ⟜ yin practice, counter-pose to yang momentum

**hold the position** ⟜ stay in pause, resist pull to continue
**find your edge** ⟜ work with current capacity
**don't chase experience** ⟜ stop adding just because you can
**allow relaxation** ⟜ let the fussing release
**passive awareness** ⟜ observe without acting
**release and reset** ⟜ when ready, return to yang
