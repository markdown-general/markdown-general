## upstream

To send something upstream is to make a note and remember to attach it to the final reporting, as upstream.md.

It is also a signal that a section of the conversation is not the focus of the main investigation. "Sending it upstream" is akin to "Don't worry about it", to reduce burdens and attention drift away from the current task.
